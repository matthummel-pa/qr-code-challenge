# CSS component coding practice for Front-end Mentor

This is a practice challenge created for [Front-end Mentor](https://frontendmentor.com).  

## Technology Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Challenges Faced

I had trouble lining up the container box in the center as well as making it responsive.  To address the issue I used I used the display property of flex and justify content center.  

I wanted to personalize the project by trying to figure out how to create my own qr code. For this I used Canva's free QR code generator.
